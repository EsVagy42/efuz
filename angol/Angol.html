                Globalisation
            </h1>
            <p>
                Globalisation helps developing countries develop and catch up with developed countries therefore it is good for them. Supporters say that globalisation can make the world a better place and it can get rid of unemployment and poverty. On the other hand disagreers argue that traditional values disappear because to them. They say that cultural intermingling is bad for the countries' culture. Cultural intermingling happens when one countrie's culture meets an other countrie's culture and cultural elements integrate from one to the other.
