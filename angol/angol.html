                Globalisation

            <p>
                Globalisation helps developing countries develop and catch up with developed countries therefore it is good for them. Supporters say that globalisation can make the world a better place and it can get rid of unemployment and poverty. On the other hand disagreers argue that traditional values disappear because to them. They say that cultural intermingling is bad for the countries' culture. Cultural intermingling happens when one countrie's culture meets an other countrie's culture and cultural elements integrate from one to the other.

                A book review
            </h1>
            <p>
                K. Hosserni's first novel is the Kite Runner.
                It's a powerful story of friendship.
                <u>It is set in</u> Kabul in the seventies. It is an open minded and liberal city.
                It describes the dramatic political events together with Ami's close friendship with Hassan. However, Amir betrays his friend and leaves him because of the war.
                Hosseini's writing style is always easy and clear to follow. The story moves along at a fast pace and takes us on an incredible journey of the boy's youth and the anxiety of the war.
                Kite Runner is a dramatic novel that is full of action and emotion.
                The ending suggests that there might be a better future both for the characters and Afghanistan.
